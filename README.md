DATE: 07th Nov 2024 TIME: 3 Days
Instructions: All questions using the Python language for your solutions
Question 1: Library Management System (10 marks)
Scenario: You are building a basic library management system to track books and
borrowers.
Task:
• Create a `Book` class with attributes for `title`, `author`, and `is_borrowed`
(boolean).
• Create a `LibraryMember` class with attributes `name`, `member_id`, and a list for
`borrowed_books`.
• Implement methods in `Book` to:
a) Mark as borrowed.
b) Mark as returned.
• Implement methods in `LibraryMember` to:
a) Borrow a book (checks if the book is available).
b) Return a book.
c) List borrowed books.
• Write interactive code to allow a member to borrow and return books.
Question 2: Online Course Management (10 marks)
Scenario: You’re designing a system to manage an online course, allowing instructors to
manage students and assignments.
Task:
• Create a `Student` class with `name`, `student_id`, and `assignments` (a dictionary
with assignment names as keys and grades as values).
• Create an `Instructor` class with `name`, `course_name`, and a list of `students`.
• Implement methods in `Student` to:
a) Add an assignment and grade.
b) Display grades.
• Implement methods in `Instructor` to:
a) Add a student to the course.

c) Display all students and their grades.
d) Write code to allow an instructor to add students and assign grades
interactively.
Question 3: Employee and Department Management (10 marks)

• Create an `Employee` class with attributes `name`, `employee_id`, and `salary`.
• Create a `Department` class with `department_name` and a list of `employees`.
• Implement methods in `Employee` to:
a) Display details.
b) Update salary.
• Implement methods in `Department` to:
a) Add an employee to the department.
b) Calculate and display the total salary expenditure for the department.
c) Display all employees.
• Use interactive input to add employees to a department and display total
expenditure.
Notes
1. Each question should be completed in a single source file. So, you should submit 3
solutions in three separate files
2. Name your files by combining your student number and question number (e.g.
12345_q1.py, 12345_q2.py, 12345_q3.py)
3. Upload your solutions in personal GitHub repos, then share a link to the repository
(ensure repo is public for the duration of the semester)
4. As a best practice, you can have the three files in a directory and then push the
directory to GitHub.
5. Upload the link to the GitHub repository containing your solutions on the
provided upload section on eLearning portal.
6. Submit your work by the due date: 10/11/2024, 11:59PM
